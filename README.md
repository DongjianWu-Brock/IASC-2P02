# Mphone, the cellphone that can play music. 
Today is Dec 18, 1995, and the current time in New York City is 5:00 A.M.  Why do so many people stand in line at a cellphone store? I am still confused about it. Yesterday, BO$$ Jay told me to line up here today. BO$$ Jay is his artist; he is a rapper and has a lot of FKAs, like $ick Ruffian, Eliminator, etc. By the way, I am a music producer, and all of his beats are produced by me. Anyway, his real name is Jay Carter. He always asks his friends to call his artist name, but everyone just calls him Jay. Where is Jay? He told me to come here but where he is. 
"Yo, Joey. You came here pretty early," Jay calls my name while I am thinking about where he is.
"Yup, I came here at 4:00 A.M as you told, and You came here at almost 5:30 A.M."
"I am sorry about that, Joey. You know I am not a self-regulated person like you. By the way, can you stop flipping your middle finger?"
I put down my middle finger and say, "So why are we lining up at a cellphone store? I hear many people are talking about MPhone. What is that?"
"Oh my god, Joey. Did you watch TV this month? MPhone is a game-changing newcomer that will challenge the music industry!" Jay says with great excitement.
I am confused and say, "No, I didn't watch TV. You said it's game-changing for the music industry. I don't understand. So, how can a cellphone be related to the music industry?" 
"Well, Joey. Do not think of it as a TRADITION cellphone. MPhone is compatible with music players."
"So it means I can play music by using this cellphone?"
"Yes, you can use this one to play music wherever you are. What an incredible invention!" again, Jay says it with excitement. I can hear his tone is ramping up and down.
"Okay, it sounds pretty dope."
"Come on, Joey! It's not dope. It's dope!!! Show me your excitement!!!"
"Damn, Jay, can you do not act like a psychopath. Everyone's eyes are on you. Calm down, please. I already have an MP3. Why do I have to buy it?"
"Okay, gimme a couple of seconds. I have to put my mind in the refrigerator for a while." Jay says with rapid snuffles.
"Go ahead, Jay. Have some deep breathes."
After many breathe, Jay explains, "Okay, Joey, Let me explain it. This cellphone has a better sound quality than MP3s because it has a very great chip that supports hi-fi audio. Also, it is compatible with music radios. You can use it to listen to music radio channels such as CBC Music. Its price is way lower than buying an ordinary cellphone and an MP3 together."
It sounds pretty convincing, and I respond, "Okay. I hope it's not hype. Anyway, I will buy one as well. By the way, you are behind me in the line. Do not try to sneakily stand in front of me."

One week later...

Today is Dec 25, one week after I bought an MPhone. The shape of this MPhone looks similar to my previous Nokia cellphone. Both of them are rectangular-shaped and have a similar size to my palm. There are more buttons on the front of my MPhone than Nokia. They all have the basic controls. However, MPhone has adittional buttons for its music player function. Jay is a liar, but last time he didn't lie to me. I have never brought my MP3 out of my room since the day I got the MPhone.  MPhone has a better chip that provides better sound quality than MP3. Although MP3 was invented last year, MPhone has already been replaced. On the street, most people are using their MPhone to listen to music. To download music on MPhone, you have to send mails to music companies. In the text,  you have to type "download + special codes" to download specific tracks. Downloading a three-minute track takes approximately five minutes because it takes a couple of minutes for music companies to respond to your message. However, downloading multiple tracks at the same time will be faster. For instance, it takes only thirty-five minutes to download ten tracks in a total of thirty minutes long. After you downloaded music, you can manage them in the music player function. While downloading music on MPhone is really complicated, but it could not stop people's passion. Oh, by the way, many people are still using MP3 right now. Why? Some of them believe that MPhone is not something new. In their opinion, MPhone is just a mixture of MP3 and cellphone. Therefore, they don't think it is necessary to get an MPhone. Besides, some of them don't have an MPhone because it is sold out. They have to wait for months to get an MPhone.
Anyways, I do agree with some people that MPhone is not a very novel thing. It is just a combination of MP3 and cellphone with a better chip. However, this sort of combination really has a big impact on our daily lives. We don't need to bring both MP3 and a cellphone when we want to enjoy some music outside. With the rapid technology development, maybe in one day, MPhone will become a portable cinema. Who knows?
